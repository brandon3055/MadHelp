# MadHelp
Mad Help is a mod designed for mod pack creators at the request of GreatOrator the creator of the tolkiencrat mod pack.
 
Features:
Map Installer
This is mad help's main feature. It allows pack creators to set up a list of maps that the user can select from. The mod can then download and install these maps in the client.
Along with full maps the installer is also capable of downloading specific regions and merging them with an existing map.

Splash Screen
This is a configurable "Wall of text" that can be displayed the first time the pack is loaded before the main menu. It can also be configured to show every time the pack is loaded, When the pack is updated, When an online configuration file is updated or not at all.

Cheat Deterrent
This is an option that allows you to remove the "Game Mode" and "Allow Cheats" buttons from the LAN Multiplayer menu. Of course if players are determined enough to cheat there are ways around around this such as simply disabling this feature in the config. But by removing the easy option this should reduce the temptation to cheat. 

Online Configuration
The json files used to configure the list of map downloads and the splash screen can be stored online e.g. in a github repository. This allows the pack creator to  update the map selection and splash screen on the fly without having to release a new version of the pack.
